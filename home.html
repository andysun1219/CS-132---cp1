            <p>
            The Akita is a large Japanese dog breed. 
            The Akita breed originated from the hunting dogs in the Tohoku region
            of northern Japan. They were bred to hunt boars, deer, and bears. Akitas
            were first introduced to America by Hellen Keller in 1938.
            Akitas are known to be independent and loyal dogs. Ther loyalty is 
            epitomized by the infamous story of Hachiko, an Akita who waited at the train
            station everyday for his owner years after the owner had died. 
            However, they also tend to be more aloof, aggresive, stubborn, and 
            territorial than other breeds. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Akitas are actually considered to be two seprate breeds: the American Akita
            and the Japanese Akita. This occured after Akitas in America began diverging
            from the Akitas in Japan. There are signficant differences between the two types
            of Akitas which is highlighted in the Japanese vs. American Akita page.

                Fitzgerald is my male Akita. His favorite foods are white rice,
                salmon, and french fries. He enjoys running, napping, and eating.
